# Recommendations

## Budget Allocation:

Reallocate  advertising  budget  to  emphasize  TV  (70-80%)  and  Radio  (20-25%),  while  reducing
Newspaper spending to 0-5% given its minimal impact.

## Campaign Optimization:

Conduct A/B testing on TV ad creatives and time slots to maximize ROI. Radio ads should focus on
peak commute hours.

## Future Data Collection:

Expand  tracking  to  include  digital  advertising  channels  (social  media,  search  engines)  in  future
analyses.

## Model Deployment:

Implement the prediction model as an API for real-time budget optimization and scenario planning.
